## Synopsis

Creates a function to add Sidebar and Footer widgets to your WordPress theme.

## Motivation

A lot of new WordPress designers hard code the sidebar and footer to their theme. This allows the site owner to add content to the sidebar and footer without knowing code.

## Installation

Copy the code in the widgets.php file into your theme's functions.php file. If you do not have a functions.php file, create one in the root of your theme directory.
