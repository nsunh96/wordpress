## Synopsis

Creates a function to add a menu to your WordPress theme.

## Motivation

Instead of hard-coding your menu, you can use this WordPress function to add a dynamic menu to the header of your WordPress theme.

## Installation

Copy the code in the register-menus.php file into your theme's functions.php file. If you do not have a functions.php file, create one in the root of your theme directory. The site owner can then add pages to the menu using the menus link under the appearance section of the WordPress Admin dashboard.
